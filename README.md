Hello, my name is Allison and I'm learning how to code. 
I spent a few years working as a social worker but recently decided to change careers.

I really enjoy the process of building projects and seeing the finished, working product. 
I've learned a few different languages through my programming courses, 
but Java is my favorite so far. 

In my free time, I like to play the Sims and take dance classes.
My primary dance is Brazilian zouk but I also dance kizomba, salsa, and bachata.
